## UML of the project : 

## Design patterns in the project : 
-> Singleton pattern : used to restrict the instantiation of a class to one single instance.
   We used twice : on the Board class (only one board needs to be created when we execute the program) and on the 
   
-> MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern : in the first version we used it with the class Controller and we used it after that with Unity

-> Simple factory pattern : we used it to create the cases of the board. We have a parent class Case with attributes ans methods and children classes for the different types of cases and their different behavior (Properties, Jail ...)
